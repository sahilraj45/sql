## Data Description
The project utilizes four tables containing pizza sales data:

### Orders Table
Columns: order_id, date, time
### Order Details Table
Columns: order_details_id, order_id, pizza_id, quantity
### Pizza Types Table
Columns: pizza_type_id, name, category, ingredients
### Pizzas Table
Columns: pizza_id, pizza_type_id, size, price

## Step-by-Step Process:

### Step 1: Log into MySQL:
Open the MySQL command-line client and log in with your username and password:

        mysql -u root -p
- -u root: Specifies the username (root).
- -p: Prompts for the password.

### Step 2: Create the Database and Tables:
1. Create a New Database: Create a database to store your pizza sales data:

        CREATE DATABASE pizza_sales;
        USE pizza_sales;
- CREATE DATABASE pizza_sales;: Creates a new database named pizza_sales.
- USE pizza_sales;: Selects the pizza_sales database for use.

2. Create Tables: Create the necessary tables (orders, order_details, pizza_types, pizzas) using the following SQL commands:

        CREATE TABLE orders (
            order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
            date DATE,
            time TIME
        );

        CREATE TABLE order_details (
            order_details_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
            order_id INT,
            pizza_id INT,
            quantity INT,
            FOREIGN KEY (order_id) REFERENCES orders(order_id)
        );

        CREATE TABLE pizza_types (
            pizza_type_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
            name VARCHAR(255),
            category VARCHAR(255),
            ingredients TEXT
        );

        CREATE TABLE pizzas (
            pizza_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
            pizza_type_id INT,
            size VARCHAR(50),
            price DECIMAL(10, 2),
            FOREIGN KEY (pizza_type_id) REFERENCES pizza_types(pizza_type_id)
        );
- Each CREATE TABLE statement creates a table with specified columns and data types.
- PRIMARY KEY: Defines the primary key for each table.
- FOREIGN KEY: Establishes a relationship between tables.

### Step 3: Import Data into Tables
1. Prepare Data Files: Ensure you have CSV files for each table. For example:
- orders.csv
- order_details.csv
- pizza_types.csv
- pizzas.csv

2. Load Data into Tables: Use the LOAD DATA INFILE command to import data from CSV files into the MySQL tables. Adjust the file paths as needed.

        LOAD DATA INFILE '/path/to/orders.csv'
        INTO TABLE orders
        FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' 
        LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
        IGNORE 1 ROWS;

        LOAD DATA INFILE '/path/to/order_details.csv'
        INTO TABLE order_details
        FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' 
        LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
        IGNORE 1 ROWS;

        LOAD DATA INFILE '/path/to/pizza_types.csv'
        INTO TABLE pizza_types
        FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' 
        LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
        IGNORE 1 ROWS;

        LOAD DATA INFILE '/path/to/pizzas.csv'
        INTO TABLE pizzas
        FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' 
        LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
        IGNORE 1 ROWS;

- LOAD DATA INFILE '/path/to/file.csv': Specifies the file to load data from.
- INTO TABLE table_name: Specifies the table to load data into.
- FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',': Specifies that fields in the file are separated by commas.
- LINES TERMINATED BY '\n': Specifies that lines in the file are separated by newlines.
